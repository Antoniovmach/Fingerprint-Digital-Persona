This project involves the development of an access control system using C# that allows the registration of employee fingerprints in a database, along with personal information such as name, surname, office, and other relevant details. The system efficiently manages employee check-ins and check-outs, ensuring accurate logging of their work hours.

The solution uses Microsoft SQL Server for database management. To secure the data and ensure safe communication between system components, a secure server is implemented with Apache, enhanced by ModSecurity and ModEvasive to prevent threats and attacks.

Additionally, a web application, built with HTML and JavaScript, is provided for administrators. This interface allows for monitoring employee records, tracking attendance, and identifying late arrivals or departures in real-time.

This access control system enhances workplace security and significantly improves employee time management.
