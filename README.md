Employee Access Control System with Fingerprint Registration

This project consists of developing an access control system using C# that allows the registration of employee fingerprints in a database, along with personal information such as name, surname, office, and other relevant details. 
The system manages employee check-ins and check-outs, ensuring accurate logging of their work hours.

Additionally, a secure server is implemented using Apache to protect the data and ensure safe communication between components. 
A web application, built with HTML and JavaScript, is provided for administrators to monitor employee records, track attendance, and identify late arrivals or departures in real time. 
This solution enhances workplace security and improves employee time management.
